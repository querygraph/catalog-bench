## Unreleased

- Reproducibility: replaced three ambient `../../../sail` path dependencies with
  one immutable `querygraph/sail@bddb1706` workspace dependency. A standalone
  checkout now resolves the same Foyer object-store implementation regardless of
  neighboring directories, and `--locked` checks no longer depend on local Sail
  state.
